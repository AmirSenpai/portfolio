### for personal reasons i decided to re-create the whole thing from scratch and to not Fork it on GitHub

***

### â­• due to some unknown Bugs the file wont open when typing 
```npm
npm run dev
```
### on the terminal, instead head to Package.json file and debug it from there to currectly run the code

im currently looking for a way to run this code on remote server's or on GitHub PagesðŸ§¡
